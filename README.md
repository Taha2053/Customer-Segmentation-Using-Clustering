# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies, optimize product recommendations, and improve customer engagement.

### The project follows these key steps:
1. Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding customer attributes through visualization.
3. Feature Selection & Scaling – Selecting relevant features and normalizing data.
4. Applying Clustering (K-Means) – Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and segmenting customers.
5. Results & Insights – Visualizing and interpreting the customer segments for business applications.
